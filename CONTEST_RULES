The First ASCII Soccer World Championship: Official Rules
==========================================================
Join the fun, submit an ASCII Soccer team!  My guess is that you can
write a competitive team in about two hours.  

Source code
-----------
Version 1.2 of ASCII Soccer is the official version for the contest.  
It is available by ftp at ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/people/tucker/soccer.1.2.tar.Z
The only changes to this release will be for bug fixes.

Sign-up
-------
No sign-up is required, but if you are considering submitting a team, 
please let me know, so I can advise you of any rule changes or bug fixes.

Submissions
-----------
To be considered for the championship, soccer team source code must arrive
by e-mail to me (tucker@cc.gatech.edu) before high noon on Thursday, May 18.
Submitted teams' source code will not be available to other competitors
until after the contest. 

Games
-----
Games between teams will run until the first team scores 1000 points.
The command-line is: "soccer -d -p 1000".  

Contest Scoring
---------------
Each team will play every other team once.  Teams will be ranked by number
of wins.  2-way ties are resolved by the score of the game between those
teams.  3-or-more-way ties will be resolved by total points scored minus
total points scored against.  Remaining ties, remain ties!

Disqualification
----------------
Anything not forbidden is permitted.  Forbidden items include: accessing
memory declared outside your team's .c file and deliberate infinite loops.
Teams that take more than 1 hour to complete a game versus the teams/example.c 
team on an unloaded Sparc 2 will be disqualified.

Award Ceremony
--------------
An award will be given to the first place team at a ceremony TBA.
