	A very basic soccer strategy.  All four players attempt to run
	up to the ball and kick it west!

#include "players.h"
/* 
players.h includes a rather unusual macro, UN().  This macro
will convert the names of the functions in this .c file to
unique names.  For instance, if this were the east team, UN(team_name)()
will become EASTteam_name().  This is necessary for the automatic
compiling and linking of arbitrary teams for tournaments.

Below are the functions player1() through player4().  Each
function is passed 4 parameters.  The incoming parameters are 
the robot's sensory information:  

	local_area[]	Reveals what's nearby.  Indexed by
			N,NE,E,SE,S, etc. so that, for example,
			local_area[S] tells you what is in the
			cell to the south of the robot.  Possible 
			values include: BOUNDARY, OPPONENT, TEAMMATE,
			BALL and EMPTY.

	ball_direction	Compass heading to the ball: N, S, E, W, NE, etc.

	x, y		The robot's location.  y varies from 1 to 22,
			x varies from 1 to 78.

The function should return an integer indicating either a direction to
move (N, NE, E, S, etc) or KICK to kick the ball.
