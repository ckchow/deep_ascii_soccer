<H3>Overview</H3>
This program is a tool for investigating how groups of simple agents
interact while playing a soccer-like game.  You can develop your own
team strategies and test them against others.
Two teams of players attempt to push a ball across the other team's
goal.  The game can be viewed on your screen using
ASCII-animation(r) technology.  Get the distribution here:
<P>
<A HREF="asciisoccer.zip">asciisoccer.zip</A>
<P>
For a synopsis of what's new in version 2.0, see the NEW file.
<P>
<H3>Compatibility</H3>

This is AS IS unsupported software.  It has been tested, and
runs on Mac OSX, RedHat Linux and Ubuntu Linux.
To unpack the source code you will need zip
To compile you will need make, gcc, csh, and the curses and termcap
libraries.

<H3>Quickstart</H3>

Get the distribution (above).  After you've unzipped asciisoccer.zip, type
<PRE>
        ./make clean
        ./contest random brute
</PRE>
This will set up a soccer match between the "random" team and
the "brute" team, by compiling and linking teams in the directories
teams/random and teams/brute.  If it does not compile, you
probably don't have all the software you need to compile it.
See "compatibility"  above.  Don't be too concerned about "warnings"
but "errors" are bad!  After the compilation is complete the teams
will automatically start a game.  The first team to 7 points wins.
To run another game, type "./soccer"
<P>
This is what a game looks like:

</PRE>

<H3>Rules</H3>

The teams consist of four players.  Each team member is provided
with sensors that tell it about the immediately adjoining 8 cells,
a compass heading towards the ball, and their location on the
field.  Players can push the ball by trying to move to the cell it
occupies, but they cannot move over one another or outside the
boundaries.  Players may also kick the ball if they are immediately
next to it.  A kicked ball travels 10 cells at 8 times the speed
of a player.  When kicking the ball, the player also moves into
the cell were the ball was previously.
<P>
A point is scored when the ball is pushed or kicked across a goal line.
The game continues until the first team scores 7 points.
<P>
Occasionally, the ball gets "stuck" between two competitors.  In that case
the ball is automatically "nudged" up or down, so play can resume.

<H3>Designing Your Own Team</H3>

Take a look at teams/random/main.c as a start.  There are several
things to keep in mind as you write your code:
<OL>
<LI>You MUST have the following functions:
                player1(), player2(), player3(), player4() and
                team_name(), initialize_point(), won_point(),
                lost_point(), initialize_game(), game_over().
                Just use the random team as a shell and this will
                happen for you.
<P>
<LI>Always assume you are the East Team: you start on the
                east side and you want to push the ball to the west.
                The program will automatically reverse things for
                you when you start on the other side.
</OL>
The player() functions represent each player's strategy, the team_name
function is used to print your team's name on the screen.
<P>
You will notice a macro called unique_name().  This is used to ensure that
function and variable names are not duplicated between team's .c files.
For instance, for the east team, unique_name(team_name)() will become EASTteam_name().
This is necessary for the automatic compiling and linking of arbitrary teams
for tournaments.  It also allows the same team to play itself.  Be sure to
use the macro around all functions and global variables in your main.c file.
<P>
The players are actually functions player1() through player4().  Each
function is passed 4 parameters.  The incoming parameters are the robot's
sensory information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>local_area[] : Reveals what's nearby.  Indexed by
                        N,NE,E,SE,S, etc. so that, for example,
                        local_area[S] tells you what is in the
                        cell to the south of the robot.  Possible
                        values include: BOUNDARY, OPPONENT, TEAMMATE,
                        BALL and EMPTY.
<P>
<LI>ball_direction : Compass heading to the ball: N, S, E, W, NE, etc.
<P>
<LI>x, y :   The robot's location.  y varies from 1 to 22,
                        x varies from 1 to 78.  +x is east, +y is south.
                        0 and 79 are goal lines, so your players will never
                        occupy those locations.
</UL>
Each player function should return an integer indicating either a
direction to move (N, NE, E, S, etc) or KICK to kick the ball.

<H3>How the Compiling and Linking Works</H3>

<P>
Compiling and linking is rather hairy mostly because we can link together 
any two arbitrary teams, and they can play on either side of the field.  
Fortunately, if you
just copy everything from the teams/random directory to a new directory,
and develop your team there, you shouldn't have to worry about this too much.
<P>
The default makefile assumes your team is coded in main.c .
main.c is compiled into either west.o or east.o depending on whether your
team will take the east or west side of the field.  The symbols WEST_TEAM
and EAST_TEAM are defined/not defined according to which side you're on.
<P>
The makefile also compiles common.c which is presumed to include functions
and globals that do not have unique names and that might be shared if your
team was playing itself.  Even if you don't use common.c, don't remove it!
the contest script and makefiles aren't smart enough not to use it. I found
I needed this to make it easier to use some c++ classes I use for my
learning team.
<P>
Finally, the .o files are grouped into libraries: libeast.a libwest.a
and libcommon.a .  The contest script copies the appropriate libraries
up to the top directory, then links soccer.o with them to generate the
final executable.
<P>
You can take advantage of this library approach now to design more complex
teams composed of several separately compiled modules - but you don't have
to!  Just make sure your makefile correctly generates libeast.a libwest.a
and libcommon.a .
<P>

<H3>Advanced Techniques</H3>

There are some additional hooks for learning, etc. which you may choose
to use.  You will notice at the bottom of random.c there are several
additional functions with no body.  These functions are automatically
called at various points in the game, as follows:
<UL>
        <LI>initialize_game()       Called once per game before play begins.
        <LI>game_over()             Called once per game at the end of the game.
        <LI>initialize_point()      Called once per point before play begins.
        <LI>lost_point()            Called if your team loses a point.
        <LI>won_point()             Called if your team wins a point.
</UL>
You may find these functions handy for initialization and learning strategies.

<H3>Command-line Arguments</H3>

The soccer executable offers a few command-line arguments you may want
to use:
<UL>
        <LI>-d              Don't display the game on the screen.
        <LI>-s seed         Use seed as the random seed for the game.
                        time() is used otherwise.
        <LI>-p points       Play to points instead of the default 7.
</UL>


<H3>Bugs, Gripes, Complaints</H3>

I don't promise ANYTHING, but I am very glad to see your teams and hear
about bugs.  Especially if you have fixed them!!!!
