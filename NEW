What's new

v2.0	15 Nov 95
-----------------

Added call to team function void UN(game_over)() so that learning teams
can save their state before the program exits.

Changed the type of these functions from char * to void:

	void UN(won_point)()
	void UN(lost_point)()
	void UN(initialize_point)()
	void UN(initialize_game)()

Fixed bug where one team's score was not initialized.

Changed directory structure in ./teams Now each team has it's own
subdirectory and makefile.

Changed compilation procedure.  Each team generates a group of
libraries that are linked together to form soccer.  See the readme for
this.

Added packteam and unpackteam scripts that will pack up a team for
e-mail shipping.


Upgrading from v1.5
===================

It is fairly easy to convert your old team to the new format.  First, 
save your old soccer directory (rename/mv it), then uncompress and
untar v2.0.   Suppose the name of your team is fred, and you moved your
old soccer directory to soccer.old, do the following:

cd soccer
cd teams
mkdir fred
cp example/* fred
cp ../../soccer.old/teams/fred.c fred/main.c

Now edit main.c and do the following.  Change the following functions
from type char * to void:

        void UN(won_point)()
        void UN(lost_point)()
        void UN(initialize_point)()
        void UN(initialize_game)()

Add the following function:

void UN(game_over)()
{
}

That's it.  Your old team should compile and link with v2.0.
