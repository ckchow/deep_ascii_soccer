Hi Brian,

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner!

Mmmm, this is very interesting.  Seems like it is best to constrain the
ball one more cell inside the boundary; that would have less of an effect 
on the players.  I also like your idea regarding TIME_OUT, I'll apply
those to the next release.

Regrettably, I'm going to have to postpone the International Contest.
My Ph.D. advisor is on me to crank out some more work, and he knows about
ASCII soccer!!!!!   

I still welcome your reports and will slowly apply many of your changes.

How about if you provide an amiga release for the ASCII soccer homepage?
You'll be world famous!  Does amiga have tar?  Let me know.  If you
can pack it up, I'll stick it on the page.
